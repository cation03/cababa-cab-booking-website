## 3. Request a Ride
- The user must enter the pickup location, destination address, and preferred ride type.
- The database will select a ride per the user’s needs and an available driver from the database who can fulfil the driver’s request.
- When the user clicks on the request ride button, they are redirected to the end ride page, where the ride is started, and the user can end the ride at their convenience.
- The user can also view the ride history, go to settings and log out of their account through the buttons provided in the navigation bar of this page.

- This page provides the user with an option to end their current ride. Since it is not possible for us to arrange a physical ride, we have implemented this button where the user can end the ride when they press this button.
